## Abstract

This laboratory report presents a novel multi-category 3D visualization system designed for comparative analysis in gaming, research, and decision-making applications. The system employs variable-radius pie charts with stadium-style scoreboards to visualize categorical differences, particularly useful for d20-style gaming systems and statistical comparisons. Our implementation demonstrates significant advances in interactive 3D data visualization, offering real-time category selection, dynamic data editing, and intuitive comparative analysis tools.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Traditional data visualization methods for multi-category comparisons often fail to provide intuitive understanding of part-to-whole relationships while simultaneously comparing two entities. Static charts lack the interactive depth required for exploratory data analysis, particularly in gaming applications where attribute comparisons drive strategic decision-making.

### 1.2 Research Objectives

1. Develop a 3D visualization system for multi-category comparative analysis
2. Implement variable-radius pie charts that visualize proportional relationships
3. Create an integrated data management system with real-time editing capabilities
4. Demonstrate applicability to d20 gaming systems and statistical research
5. Provide open-source tools for the research community

### 1.3 Innovation Summary

Our system introduces Category-Proportional Variable-Radius Pie Charts as a novel visualization technique that fundamentally reimagines how comparative data is displayed. Unlike traditional pie charts with fixed radii, our approach calculates each slice's radius based on that entity's proportion of the category total (sum of both competing values).
Core Algorithm
For each category comparison, the system:

Calculates category total: categoryTotal = leftValue + rightValue
Determines entity proportion: entityPercentage = entityValue / categoryTotal
Scales radius proportionally: sliceRadius = baseRadius × entityPercentage

This creates a powerful dual-encoding system where:

Angular size represents the category's weight in the overall comparison
Radial size represents competitive dominance within that specific category

Our Innovation Advantages:

Immediate competitive insight: Larger radius = category winner
Proportional accuracy: Radius reflects exact winning margin
Dual information encoding: Both overall weight and competitive standing visible simultaneously
Intuitive interpretation: Visually larger slice = stronger performance in that area

Example in Practice
Consider a "Strength" category with Kobold=4, Troglodyte=6:

Category total: 10
Kobold slice radius: 9 × (4/10) = 3.6 (smaller, indicating weaker strength)
Troglodyte slice radius: 9 × (6/10) = 5.4 (larger, indicating stronger strength)
Angular sizes: Both maintain proportional representation in overall comparison

This technique enables researchers and analysts to instantly identify not just which categories matter most (angular size), but also who dominates each category and by how much (radial size), creating a more information-dense and analytically powerful visualization than traditional comparative methods.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Equipment and Technology Stack

- **Primary Platform:** Claude.ai for development assistance
- **Rendering Engine:** Three.js (r128) with WebGL
- **Data Management:** JSON-based with real-time editing
- **Interface:** HTML5 Canvas with interactive controls
- **Deployment:** Web-based, cross-platform compatible

### 2.2 System Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Data Layer    │    │ Visualization   │    │  Interaction    │
│   - JSON Store  │◄──►│   - Three.js    │◄──►│   - Mouse       │
│   - Live Edit   │    │   - WebGL       │    │   - Table       │
│   - Validation  │    │   - Shaders     │    │   - Real-time   │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

### 2.3 Core Algorithm: Variable-Radius Calculation

```javascript
function calculateSliceRadius(categoryIndex, isLeft) {
  const leftValue = data[categoryIndex].kobold;
  const rightValue = data[categoryIndex].troglodyte;
  const categoryTotal = leftValue + rightValue;
  const baseRadius = 9;
  
  if (isLeft) {
    return baseRadius * (leftValue / categoryTotal);
  } else {
    return baseRadius * (rightValue / categoryTotal);
  }
}
```

This algorithm ensures that:
- Larger values produce larger slice radii
- Proportional relationships remain visually apparent
- Comparative analysis is intuitive and immediate
