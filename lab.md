# Lab Notes: Professional Rust + Bevy Dev Workflow

## Intention
- Set up a professional Rust development environment for 3D work using Bevy.
- Integrate Makefile for common dev tasks: setup, build, debug.
- Enable VS Code debugging with breakpoints in main.rs.
- Document all steps and decisions for reproducibility.

## Steps
1. Initialized cargo project with `cargo init --vcs none`.
2. Will add Bevy as a dependency in Cargo.toml.
3. Will create a minimal main.rs that spawns a 3D cube.
4. Will update Makefile for setup, build, and debug workflows.
5. Will ensure VS Code debugging works for breakpoints in main.rs.

## Next Steps
- Add Bevy dependency and development settings.
- Write main.rs with a simple 3D cube.
- Update Makefile for seamless dev experience.
